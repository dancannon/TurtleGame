Pacman - TurtleChallenge
------------------------
This game is for the UoB FY SWW challenge. The aim of the competition was to test all of the skills learned over the course of the module by creating an interesting program using the Turtle library.
I decided to create a simple version of Pacman.

## Requirements ##

To play this game you must have at least Java 1.7 installed.
To build the game you must also have the Javalib.jar file. Unfortunately I cannot distribute that file.

## Running ##

To run the game you should first extract the Pacman.zip archive. Run either the play.bat or play.sh script depending on your OS.

## Playing ##
To play the game simply use either your WSAD or arrow keys to move Pacman round the maze. Attempt to collect all of the yellow dots without getting eaten by the ghosts.
GL HF!
